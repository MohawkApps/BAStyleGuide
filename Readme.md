# Beer Style Guides
### A [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) application brought to you by [Mohawk Apps](http://www.mohawkapps.com/).

## How to run the app:

2. Run `bundle`.
3. Run `rake compile:ba` to compile all assets for the Brewers Association version of the project or `rake compile:bjcp` for the BJCP style guidelines version of the app.
4. The simulator should launch automatically.
