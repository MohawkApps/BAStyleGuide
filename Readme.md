# Brewers Alliance Style Guides
### A [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) application brought to you by [Mohawk Apps](http://www.mohawkapps.com/).

## How to run the app:

1. You must have a valid license of RubyMotion.
2. Run `bundle`.
3. Run `rake compile` to convert the guideline files and place them in the `/resources` directory.
4. The simulator should launch automatically.
