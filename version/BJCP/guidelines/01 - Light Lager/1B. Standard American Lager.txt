							<b>Aroma:</b> Little to no malt aroma, although it can be grainy, sweet or corn-like if present. Hop aroma may range from none to a light, spicy or floral hop presence. Low levels of yeast character (green apples, DMS, or fruitiness) are optional but acceptable. No diacetyl.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Appearance:</b> Very pale straw to medium yellow color. White, frothy head seldom persists. Very clear.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Flavor:</b> Crisp and dry flavor with some low levels of grainy or corn-like sweetness. Hop flavor ranges from none to low levels. Hop bitterness at low to medium-low level. Balance may vary from slightly malty to slightly bitter, but is relatively close to even. High levels of carbonation may provide a slight acidity or dry "sting." No diacetyl. No fruitiness.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Mouthfeel:</b> Light body from use of a high percentage of adjuncts such as rice or corn. Very highly carbonated with slight carbonic bite on the tongue. 
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Overall Impression:</b> Very refreshing and thirst quenching.
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>Comments:</b> Strong flavors are a fault. An international style including the standard mass-market lager from most countries.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Ingredients:</b> Two- or six-row barley with high percentage (up to 40%) of rice or corn as adjuncts.
