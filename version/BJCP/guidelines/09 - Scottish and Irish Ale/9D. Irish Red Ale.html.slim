p
  b Aroma:
  | Low to moderate malt aroma, generally caramel-like but occasionally toasty or toffee-like in nature.  May have a light buttery character (although this is not required).  Hop aroma is low to none (usually not present).  Quite clean.
p
  b Appearance:
  | Amber to deep reddish copper color (most examples have a deep reddish hue).  Clear.  Low off-white to tan colored head.
p
  b Flavor:
  | Moderate caramel malt flavor and sweetness, occasionally with a buttered toast or toffee-like quality.  Finishes with a light taste of roasted grain, which lends a characteristic dryness to the finish.  Generally no flavor hops, although some examples may have a light English hop flavor.  Medium-low hop bitterness, although light use of roasted grains may increase the perception of bitterness to the medium range.  Medium-dry to dry finish.  Clean and smooth (lager versions can be very smooth).  No esters.
p
  b Mouthfeel:
  | Medium-light to medium body, although examples containing low levels of diacetyl may have a slightly slick mouthfeel.  Moderate carbonation.  Smooth.  Moderately attenuated (more so than Scottish ales).  May have a slight alcohol warmth in stronger versions.
p
  b Overall Impression:
  | An easy-drinking pint.  Malt-focused with an initial sweetness and a roasted dryness in the finish.
p
  b Comments:
  | Sometimes brewed as a lager (if so, generally will not exhibit a diacetyl character).  When served too cold, the roasted character and bitterness may seem more elevated.
p
  b Ingredients:
  | May contain some adjuncts (corn, rice, or sugar), although excessive adjunct use will harm the character of the beer.  Generally has a bit of roasted barley to provide reddish color and dry roasted finish.  UK/Irish malts, hops, yeast.
