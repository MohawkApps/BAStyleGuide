<h1>Brewers Association<br />
2013 Beer Style Guidelines</h1>

<h2>February 28, 2013</h2>

<p>Compiled for the Brewers Association by Charlie Papazian, copyright: 1993 through
and including 2013. With Style Guideline Committee assistance and review by Paul Gatza,
Chris Swersey and suggestions from Great American Beer Festival and World Beer Cup
judges.</p>

<p>Since 1979 the Brewers Association has provided beer style descriptions as a
reference for brewers and beer competition organizers. Much of the early work was based
on the assistance and contributions of beer journalist Michael Jackson. The task of
creating a realistic set of guidelines is always complex. The beer style guidelines
developed by the Brewers Association use sources from the commercial brewing industry,
beer analyses, and consultations with beer industry experts and knowledgeable beer
enthusiasts as resources for information.</p>

<p>The Brewers Association' beer style guidelines reflect, as much as possible,
historical significance, authenticity or a high profile in the current commercial beer
market. Often, the historical significance is not clear, or a new beer in a current
market may be only a passing fad, and thus, quickly forgotten. For these reasons, the
addition of a style or the modification of an existing one is not undertaken lightly
and is the product of research, consultation and consideration of market actualities,
and may take place over a period of time. Another factor considered is that current
commercial examples do not always fit well into the historical record, and instead
represent a modern version of the style. Our decision to include a particular
historical beer style takes into consideration the style's brewing traditions and the
need to preserve those traditions in today's market. The more a beer style has
withstood the test of time, marketplace, and consumer acceptance, the more likely it is
to be included in the Brewers Association's style guidelines.</p>

<p>The availability of commercial examples plays a large role in whether or not a beer
style "makes the list." It is important to consider that not every historical or
commercial beer style can be included, nor is every commercial beer representative of
the historical tradition (i.e., a brewery labeling a brand as a particular style does
not always indicate a fair representation of that style).</p>

<p>Please note that almost all of the classic and traditional beer style guidelines
have been cross-referenced with data from commercially available beers representative
of the style. The data referenced for this purpose has been Professor Anton Piendl's
comprehensive work published in the German Brauindustrie magazine through the years
1982 to 1994, from the series "Biere Aus Aller Welt."</p>

<p>Each style description is purposefully written independently of any reference to
another beer style. Furthermore, as much as it is possible, beer character is not
described in terms of ingredients or process. These guidelines attempt to emphasize
final evaluation of the product and try not to judge or regulate the formulation or
manner in which it was brewed, except in special circumstances that clearly define a
style.</p>

<p>The bitterness specifications (IBUs) given in these guidelines are based on standard
measurements for bitterness derived from kettle isomerization of naturally occurring
alpha acids. Since reduced isomerized hop extracts may produce substantially different
perceived bitterness levels when measured by this technique, brewers who use such
extracts should enter competitions based upon the perceived bitterness present in the
finished product. It is important to note that perceived bitterness by the beer drinker
will not always align with expectations created by IBU specifications (see below).</p>

<p><strong>Notes on Beer Style Guidelines:</strong> is very difficult to consistently
align analytical data with perceived character. It is also very difficult to
consistently align written beer descriptions with analytical data and perceived
character.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Intensity Level Terminology:</strong> flavor attributes referenced in the
    beer style guidelines are often referenced in relative terms of intensity. These
    attributes can include bitterness, flavor, aroma, body, malt, sweetness, or others.
    In order of increasing intensity the descriptions used include:

    <ul>
      <li>None</li>
      <li>Very low</li>
      <li>Low</li>
      <li>Medium-low</li>
      <li>Medium</li>
      <li>Medium-high</li>
      <li>High</li>
      <li>Very high</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Color Ranges:</strong> American SRM (Standard Reference Method) and EBC
    (European Brewing Convention) of measuring beer color measure the intensity of a
    certain wave length of light. These numerical values do not always coincide with
    our visual perception of color lightness and darkness or hue. When in doubt the
    description of color has priority. In order from lightest descriptor to darkest
    descriptor:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Color Description</th>
        <th>SRM</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Very light</td>
        <td>1-1.5</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Straw</td>
        <td>2-3</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Pale</td>
        <td>4</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Gold</td>
        <td>5-6</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Light amber</td>
        <td>7</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Amber</td>
        <td>8</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Medium amber</td>
        <td>9</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Copper/garnet</td>
        <td>10-12</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Light brown</td>
        <td>13-15</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Brown/Reddish/Chestnut</td>
        <td>16-17</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Dark brown</td>
        <td>18-24</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Very dark</td>
        <td>25-39</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Black</td>
        <td>40+</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Bitterness:</strong> the beer world bitterness is analytically measured as
    "bittering units" or "international bitterness units." The numerical value is a
    measure of a specific hop compound and will not consistently coincide with
    individual's perception of bitterness intensity.

    <ol>
      <li>Due to genetics and other differences, individuals will have varying
      sensitivity to bitterness. Some will sense high intensity bitterness, while
      others perceive no bitterness in the same beer. The descriptions of bitterness in
      these guidelines are inclined towards representing average sensitivity to
      bitterness.</li>

      <li>Other beer ingredients can contribute perception of bitterness to beer.</li>

      <li>The intensity and quality of hop flavor and aroma derived from oils, pellets,
      whole hops or other hop formats can greatly alter the perception of bitterness
      intensity.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Notes on Beer Competitions:</strong> Association Beer Style Guidelines form
the basis for the guidelines at the Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and World Beer
Cup (WBC).</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Competition Categories:</strong> and WBC categories may contain one or
  more beer styles. Categories with multiple beer styles will be organized into
  subcategories of similar style beers. Often this provides the category with a
  sufficient number of entries to make the category competitive or meet minimum entry
  numbers.</li>

  <li><strong>Beer Style Guidelines:</strong> at competition may differ somewhat from
  this guideline document. They may include special notes which pertain to that
  competition. These notes might solicit special information from brewers to be
  provided to judges so they may evaluate beer entries more accurately, or provide
  clarity to entering brewers regarding possibly confusing or overlapping aspects of
  beer style categories.</li>

  <li><strong>Pouring:</strong> entered and presented for evaluation in competitions
  should be poured and presented as intended by the brewer. Most beers are intended to
  be poured quietly; some beers are intended to be roused in order to present the beer
  with yeast that may be present in the bottle. Competition organizers should allow
  brewers the opportunity to provide explicit pouring instructions, and should present
  beers to judges in the manner requested by the brewer.</li>
</ol>
